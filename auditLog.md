### FEBRUARY
12:51:33 AM - 2/3/2023 : Kind of feeling overwhelmed from school, trying my best to cope with this... If you are reading this, i should be fine, might not sound to good for most (if not all) of February taking a HUGE toll on me :P

12:57:53 AM - 2/3/2023 : Just finished english assignent. God i hate the notes that she makes us do, but honestly i dont think ima pass the AP Lang test at all. I hope that there is a way for me to pass the test, but i just wanna get this stuff over with. Also, cant sleep. yay. [peepoo happy]

10:20:33 AM - 2/3/2023 : I feel way to tired to be working ro talking todady. IDK whats going up with me, but hopefully I will feel better around robotics competition time. Sadge that our future president is not going to be there (i think)

3:08:22 PM - 2/3/2023 : Watching the boys jv soccer game rn. Still kind of getting stressed bc of robotics competition. Other than that, GOT DAMMIT CALEB!!! WHY THE HELL ARE YOU IN A GAME BUT YOU TOLD US NOTHING ON HOW TO DO THE ROBOT????. Good to know :).

10:12:04 PM - 2/3/2023: Very stressed about robotics competition. When i mean very stressed, i mean VERY stressed. Samantha is not going to the competion AND she got grounded for the whole weeken, Jonny is not going to make it as well, so wtf do we do now? At this poitn i am going to leave it up to the seniors and the juniors are just going to sit back or help out a little bit. Very sad day today. (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

11:42:34 AM - 2/4/2023 : In robotics comp rn. We droped out (funny momment). So we are all chilling at the competition. We have been trolling around for the past 2 hours, Caleb and them were taking "notes" on other peiples robots. Honestly, this was one of the funniest ones.

9:01:22 AM - 2/5/2023 : Little bit late on this one. Still kind of contemplating life. Overall for robotics, the current juniors has alot of ideas for next year, hopefully not dissapointing mr sato. We are sill going ot finish our competition robot so we dont dissapoitn him and that we actualy care. But school work as well, killing me. And screw my confirmation class. LIKE WHAT DA HELL DO I DO WITH 3 DAYS WITH OUT MY PHONE ?????

6:00:23 PM - 2/5/2023 : Just had some good food at Blue Lotus. Saw Andrew (the softmore), was kind of funny ngl. Still need to turn in my comp sci homework, should do that once i get home. Some of my stress is kind of getting relieved bc im forgetting about most things, but still hitting me hard. Contemplating if i should work in robot durring 5th or just passout.

11:58:49 PM - 2/5/2023 : Still up at night, trying to do a raid with Sergio and them. Idk why i stayed, i rahter go to sleep and think about other things, but here we are. I think what im going to do durring 5th period would be resting and staying int he corner for now. But other than that, i might just go to sleep now. OH SHOOT I NEED TO DO MY MATH HOMEWORK. GGS BRUH

10:02:24 AM - 2/6/2023 : Currently in Ms Pratts class. Just honestly waiting for lunch to come so T can see the progress that allt he TSA memmbers have done. L BOZO people no cap. But I hate AP LANG with a passion, so i dont wnat to go to period 3 rn. Why tf did the school have to move ALL the juniors to AP LANG? Oh well, time to cope about it.

2:42:37 PM - 2/7/2023 : We just learned about how the create performance task is going to be and the requirements. Im getting a bit worried about how im going to do and the overall commitment that i am going to be putting intot his app. Im still confused about the topic I am going to choose, which is currently stumping me at the momment. Its getting a bit nervously about how its going to go, hopefully that i am going to do good on this one. Im literally going to be a comp sci major so there should be no way that i am not going to ace the actual coding part to the test, right?

9:29:32 PM - 2/7/2023 : Hi me in the future. I hope u are reading this. If you are rnot, oh well. Ima look hella stupid then. But other than that, i really dont have a comp sci topic for the create performance task. This might overall screw me over, but the topics that i want to do might not mach up with what ms kol wants me to do. Hopefully i can reserve a topic that is fun to me plus i can make a few things out of it (Like a game ore something) But like, it kind of sucks that i cant do gambling, but it does contradict what college board is NOT trying kinds to do.

9:41:24 AM - 2/8/2023 : Thank god Mr. Groven is not going to be here today, but i pray that the assignemnt that he is going to give to the people who are not going not that bad. Other than that, AP CS is getting more and more nerve racking because i dont have a topic still. There is SO much that i want to do but is restricted behind ms kols afirmation. I might ask ms kol if i can listen to music while i code, but i still need to find the overall idea that i want to do. So far, its either i talk about robotics or i talk about music. Im not sure, but hoefuly it should not be that hard.

6:22:45 PM - 2/13/2023: I just came back from my retreat, ngl that thing was kind of fun. I would not do it again but it was a very fun experience. But since i have came back, i can focus all of my attention on my code for AP COMP SCI app. Ima keep this one abit short, but i belive in all of the people currently doing the create performance task.

10:36:50 PM - 2/15/2023: I swear if jose does not shut up when we play destiny, there is going to be one less memeber in robitcs. I wished he groveled on the ground like a dog, pleading for mercy because thats what he deserved. He acts like a pet getting ordered around but also having the mindset of a rebelious baby. Like how is it physicaly and mentaly possible to have an attitue like jose? I just want to send him 6 feet under. At this point i rather kill myself than adequetly have a decent conversation with you. I HATE LIFE BRUH.

12:02:43 AM - 2/19/2023: I forgor to do audit log like for the past few days. Mb. Still having trouble concentrating on homework and other htings, but to say this, IM FKING 1 POINT OFF FROM A B in HUSH!!!!. Ima keep this one short bc i want to play some video games, maybe thats why i cant do me hw right now...

8:26:42 PM - 2/26/2023: Um.. about the audit log, i think i might just do one once a week. So yeah. Just waiting for Lightfall to come out for Destiny 2 as well as Dehya from genshin. They are both going to come out on Tuesday, so its just a few days away. School has been tiring me tf out because of homework, but other than that, its been fun talking and messing around with friends. The dance on friday ont he other hand was not that bad. I thought it was going to be way worse because of the rain but its overall ok.

10:37:23 PM - 2/27/2023: Hey its me again. Honetly wanted to jot something down rq. I honestly feel like absolute shit. Its not anyones fault, but i jusst feel like everyone is objectivly better than me in everything. If you name something, I would know who would be better at me than that. Its kind of keeping me down recently as well as other hthings. I can also say that i cant help out people enough. Its either i physicaly cant help them out or im to nervous to. Like for Samantha and Dan for their SCALE project. I feel like such a nusisance to them ranther than helping them out. I just feel guilty of all the things i have done throughout my life. If Jules or Jason is reading ths, i am fine for the time being. Just dont talk about this durring school or else i might go on a tangent or rant about my life and might actually cry. :) thxs for the consideration.

9:57:49 PM - 3/1/2023: Welcome to march! Anyways... time for me to go on a rant about my life. Me and mr-jules san are planning to make something for a special pair of people for a specific thing they are doing. (Hopefully they are not looking about this :\).
