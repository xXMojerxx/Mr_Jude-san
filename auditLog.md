12:51:33 AM - 2/3/2023 : Kind of feeling overwhelmed from school, trying my best to cope with this... If you are reading this, i should be fine, might not sound to good for most (if not all) of February taking a HUGE toll on me :P

12:57:53 AM - 2/3/2023 : Just finished english assignent. God i hate the notes that she makes us do, but honestly i dont think ima pass the AP Lang test at all. I hope that there is a way for me to pass the test, but i just wanna get this stuff over with. Also, cant sleep. yay. [peepoo happy]

10:20:33 AM - 2/3/2023 : I feel way to tired to be working ro talking todady. IDK whats going up with me, but hopefully I will feel better around robotics competition time. Sadge that our future president is not going to be there (i think)

3:08:22 PM - 2/3/2023 : Watching the boys jv soccer game rn. Still kind of getting stressed bc of robotics competition. Other than that, GOT DAMMIT CALEB!!! WHY THE HELL ARE YOU IN A GAME BUT YOU TOLD US NOTHING ON HOW TO DO THE ROBOT????. Good to know :).

10:12:04 PM - 2/3/2023: Very stressed about robotics competition. When i mean very stressed, i mean VERY stressed. Samantha is not going to the competion AND she got grounded for the whole weeken, Jonny is not going to make it as well, so wtf do we do now? At this poitn i am going to leave it up to the seniors and the juniors are just going to sit back or help out a little bit. Very sad day today. (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

11:42:34 AM - 2/4/2023 : In robotics comp rn. We droped out (funny momment). So we are all chilling at the competition. We have been trolling around for the past 2 hours, Caleb and them were taking "notes" on other peiples robots. Honestly, this was one of the funniest ones.

9:01:22 AM - 2/5/2023 : Little bit late on this one. Still kind of contemplating life. Overall for robotics, the current juniors has alot of ideas for next year, hopefully not dissapointing my sato. We are sill going ot finish our competition robot so we dont dissapoitn him and that we actualy care. But school work as well, killing me. And screw my confirmation class. LIKE WHAT DA HELL DO I DO WITH 3 DAYS WITH OUT MY PHONE ?????

6:00:23 PM - 2/5/2023 : Just had some good food at Blue Lotus. Saw Andrew (the softmore), was kind of funny ngl. Still need to turn in my comp sci homework, should do that once i get home. Some of my stress is kind of getting relieved bc im forgetting about most things, but still hitting me hard. Contemplating if i should work in robot durring 5th or just passout.

11:58:49 PM - 2/5/2023 : Still up at night, trying to do a raid with Sergio and them. Idk why i stayed, i rahter go to sleep and think about other things, but here we are. I think what im going to do durring 5th period would be resting and staying int he corner for now. But other than that, i might just go to sleep now. OH SHOOT I NEED TO DO MY MATH HOMEWORK. GGS BRUH

10:02:24 AM - 2/6/2023 : Currently in Ms Pratts class. Just honestly waiting for lunch to come so T can see the progress that allt he TSA memmbers have done. L BOZO people no cap. But I hate AP LANG with a passion, so i dont wnat to go to period 3 rn. Why tf did the school have to move ALL the juniors to AP LANG? Oh well, time to cope about it.

2:42:37 PM - 2/7/2023 : We just learned about how the create performance task is going to be and the requirements. Im getting a bit worried about how im going to do and the overall commitment that i am going to be putting intot his app. Im still confused about the topic I am going to choose, which is currently stumping me at the momment. Its getting a bit nervously about how its going to go, hopefully that i am going to do goon on this one. Im literally going to be a comp sci major so there should be no way that i am not going to ace the actual coding part to the test, right?
