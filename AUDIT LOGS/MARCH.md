12:26:30 AM - 3/15/2023: I need to take my mind off some things right now. There is way to much that happened today that my mind needs to have a mental reset. Maybe durring 5th or 7th i might take one, but for now i need to focus on my grades. They are dropping drastically, especialy my AP lang grade. I know im not the greatest at english, but i cant be doing this bad or else i cant pass the AP test. There is way to much going on in my mind, but hopefully it will all end soon. Also whats happening with discord, i can even with them at this point. Its not their fauly, bbut the overall idiocity of our friend group is getting the better of me. I need to focus more on my self than others, but i cant with the current thinking
